## Background

Hello there! My name is Colin Lynch, and I am an animal behavior Ph.D. candidate at Arizona. I primarily leverage industrial engineering techniques to design optimal experiments for the study of emergence in complex adaptive systems, and I am looking to use these techniques to aquire a data science internship in R&D. I am specifically interested in reducing research costs by developing methods that minimize sample size while still having a rich enough dataset to perform hypothesis tests and predictive analytics. This project is a technical demonstration of how I can use MATLAB, Python, and R to create a data pipeline which A) minimizes the amount of work necessary to collect data (bias reduced by 57%), B) validates data collection methodologies with simulations, C) derives many higher order features (60+) from only 2 raw measurements, and D) uses linear models and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to gain deep insights into the nature of the research question. I specifically want to know why larger ant colonies have higher metabolic rates than smaller ant colonies. See pages 1-10 and 15 of prospectus for futher discussion on the biological relevance of this question.

## Acknowledgements

This work could not have been done without the support of some fantastic scientists. I would like to thank Dr. Ioulia Bespalova for providing data I used for optimization and her comments on manuscripts, Dr. Xiaohui Guo for providing behavior videos and metabolic measurments, Dr. Jennifer Fewell and Dr. Ted Pavlic for guidance, Cole Busby for helping to develop the MATLAB application, and my undergraduate research assistants Gailan Khanania, Nathaniel Maslanka, Coleen Furey, Mariah Merriam, Tejaswini Nandakumar, and Emma Siebrandt for collecting data and managing ant colonies.
